Introduction to FasterKV C#
===========================

The FasterKV key-value store and cache in C# works in .NET Framework and .NET core, and can be used in both a 
single-threaded and highly concurrent setting. It has been tested to work on both Windows and Linux. It exposes 
an API that allows one to performs a mix of Reads, Blind Updates (Upserts), and atomic Read-Modify-Write 
operations. It supports data larger than memory, and accepts an `IDevice` implementation for storing logs on
storage. We have provided `IDevice` implementations for local file system and Azure Page Blobs, but one may create
new devices as well. We also offer meta-devices that can group device instances into sharded and tiered configurations.
FASTER  may be used as a high-performance replacement for traditional concurrent data structures such as the 
.NET ConcurrentDictionary, and additionally supports larger-than-memory data. It also supports checkpointing of the 
data structure - both incremental and non-incremental. Operations on FASTER can be issued synchronously or 
asynchronously, i.e., using the C# `async` interface.

## Getting FASTER

### Building From Sources
Clone the Git repo, open cs/FASTER.sln in Visual Studio, and build.

### NuGet
You can install FASTER binaries using Nuget, from Nuget.org. Right-click on your project, manage NuGet packages, browse 
for Microsoft.FASTER.Core. Here is a [direct link](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.FASTER.Core).

## Basic Concepts

### FASTER Operations

FASTER supports three basic operations:
1. Read: Read data from the key-value store
2. Upsert: Blind upsert of values into the store (does not check for prior values)
3. Read-Modify-Write: Update values in store atomically, used to implement operations such as Sum and Count.

### Constructor

Before instantiating the FASTER store, you need to create storage devices that FASTER will use. If you are using value
(blittable) types such as `long`, `int`, and structs with value-type members, you only need one log device. If you are 
also using objects such as classes and strings, you need to create a separate object log device.

```Csharp
var log = Devices.CreateLogDevice(@"C:\Temp\hlog.log");
```

The store constructor requires a key type and a value type. For example, an instance of FASTER over `long` keys and 
`string` values is created as follows:

```Csharp
var store = new FasterKV<long, string>(1L << 20, new LogSettings { LogDevice = log });
```

#### Constructor Parameters

1. Hash Table Size: This the number of buckets allocated to FASTER, where each bucket is 64 bytes (size of a cache line).
2. Log Settings: These are settings related to the size of the log and devices used by the log.
3. Checkpoint Settings: These are settings related to checkpoints, such as checkpoint type and folder. Covered in the 
section on checkpointing [below](#checkpointing-and-recovery).
4. Serialization Settings: Used to provide custom serializers for key and value types. Serializers implement 
`IObjectSerializer<Key>` for keys and `IObjectSerializer<Value>` for values. *These are only needed for 
non-blittable types such as C# class objects.*
5. Key Equality comparer: Used for providing a better comparer for keys, implements `IFasterEqualityComparer<Key>`.

The total in-memory footprint of FASTER is controlled by the following parameters:
1. Hash table size: This parameter (the first contructor argument) times 64 is the size of the in-memory hash table in bytes.
2. Log size: The logSettings.MemorySizeBits denotes the size of the in-memory part of the hybrid log, in bits. In other 
words, the size of the log is 2^B bytes, for a parameter setting of B. Note that if the log points to class key or value 
objects, this size only includes the 8-byte reference to the object. The older part of the log is spilled to storage.

### Callback Functions

The user provides an instance of a type that implements `IFunctions<Key, Value, Input, Output, Context>`, or its corresponding 
abstract base class `<Key, Value, Input, Output, Context>`. Apart from Key and Value, functions use three new types:
1. `Input`: This is the type of input provided to FASTER when calling Read or RMW. It may be regarded as a parameter for the 
Read or RMW operation. For example, with RMW, it may be the delta being accumulated into the value.
2. `Output`: This is the type of the output of a Read operation. The reader copies the relevant parts of the Value to Output.
3. `Context`: User-defined context for the operation. Use `Empty` if there is no context necesssary.


`IFunctions<>` encapsulates all callbacks made by FASTER back to the caller, and are described next:

1. SingleReader and ConcurrentReader: These are used to read from the store values and copy them to Output. Single reader can 
assume that there are no concurrent operations on the record.
2. SingleWriter and ConcurrentWriter: These are used to write values to the store, from a source value. Concurrent writer can 
assume that there are no concurrent operations on the record.
3. Completion callbacks: Called by FASTER when various operations complete.
4. RMW Updaters: There are three updaters that the user specifies, InitialUpdater, InPlaceUpdater, and CopyUpdater. Together, 
they are used to implement the RMW operation.


### Sessions

Once FASTER is instantiated, one issues operations to FASTER by creating logical sessions. A session represents a "mono-threaded" sequence 
of operations issued to FASTER. There is no concurrency within a session, but different sessions may execute concurrently. Sessions do not
need to be affinitized to threads, but if they are, FASTER can leverage the same (covered later). You create a session as follows:

```var session = store.NewSession(new Functions());```

An equivalent, but more optimized API requires you to specify the Functions type a second time (it allows us to avoid accessing the 
session via an interface call):

```cs
var session = store.For(new Functions()).NewSession<Functions>();
```

You can then perform a sequence of read, upsert, and RMW operations on the session. FASTER supports sync and async versions of 
operations. The operations are described below.

#### Read

```cs
var status = session.Read(ref key, ref output);
var status = session.Read(ref key, ref input, ref output, ref context, ref serialNo);
await session.ReadAsync(key, input);
```

#### Upsert

```cs
var status = session.Upsert(ref key, ref value);
var status = session.Upsert(ref key, ref value, ref context, ref serialNo);
await session.UpsertAsync(key, value);
```

#### RMW

```cs
var status = session.RMW(ref key, ref input);
var status = session.RMW(ref key, ref input, ref context, ref serialNo);
await session.RMWAsync(key, input);
```

### Disposing

At the end, the session is disposed:

```session.Dispose();```

When all sessions are done operating on FASTER, you finally dispose the FasterKV instance:

```store.Dispose();```


## Quick End-To-End Sample

Following is a simple end-to-end sample where all data is in memory, so we do not worry about pending 
I/O operations. There is no checkpointing in this example as well.

```cs
public static void Test()
{
  var log = Devices.CreateLogDevice("C:\\Temp\\hlog.log");
  var store = new FasterKV<long, long>(1L << 20, new Funcs(), new LogSettings { LogDevice = log });
  var s = fht.NewSession(new SimpleFunctions<long, long>);
  long key = 1, value = 1, input = 10, output = 0;
  s.Upsert(ref key, ref value);
  s.Read(ref key, ref output);
  Debug.Assert(output == value);
  s.RMW(ref key, ref input);
  s.RMW(ref key, ref input);
  s.Read(ref key, ref output);
  Debug.Assert(output == value + 20);
  s.StopSession();
  store.Dispose();
  log.Close();
}
```

We use default out-of-the-box provided `SimpleFunctions<Key,Value>` in the above example. In these functions,
`Input` and `Output` are simply set to `Value`, while `Context` is an empty struct `Empty`.

## Checkpointing and Recovery

FASTER supports **checkpoint-based recovery**. Every new checkpoint persists (or makes durable) additional user-operations
(Read, Upsert or RMW). FASTER allows clients to keep track of operations that have persisted and those that have not using 
a session-based API. 

Recall that each FASTER client starts a session, associated with a unique session ID (or name). All FASTER session operations
(Read, Upsert, RMW) carry a monotonic sequence number (sequence numbers are implicit in case of async calls). At any point in 
time, one may call `Checkpoint` to initiate an asynchronous checkpoint of FASTER. After calling `Checkpoint`, each FASTER 
session is (eventually) notified of a commit point. A commit point consists of (1) a sequence number, such that all operations
until, and no operations after, that sequence number, are guaranteed to be persisted as part of that checkpoint; (2) an optional
exception list of operations that were not part of the commit because they went pending and could not complete before the 
checkpoint, because the session was not active at the time of checkpointing.

The commit point information can be used by the session to clear any in-memory buffer of operations waiting to be performed. 
During recovery, sessions can continue using `ResumeSession` invoked with the same session ID. The function returns the thread-local 
sequence number until which that session hash been recovered. The new thread may use this information to replay all uncommitted 
operations since that point.

With async session operations on FASTER, one may optionally set a boolean parameter `waitForCommit` in the calls. When set, the async 
call completes only after the operation is made persistent by an asynchronous checkpoint. The user is responsible for performing the 
checkpoint asynchronously. An async upsert which returns only after the upsert is made durable, is shown below:

```cs
await session.UpsertAsync(key, value, waitForCommit: true);
```

Below, we show a simple recovery example with asynchronous checkpointing.

```Csharp
public class PersistenceExample 
{
  private FasterKV<long, long, long, long, Empty, Funcs> fht;
  private IDevice log;
  
  public PersistenceExample() 
  {
    log = Devices.CreateLogDevice("C:\\Temp\\hlog.log");
    fht = new FasterKV<long, long, long, long, Empty, Funcs>
    (1L << 20, new Funcs(), new LogSettings { LogDevice = log });
  }
  
  public void Run()
  {
    IssuePeriodicCheckpoints();
    RunSession();
  }
  
  public void Continue()
  {
    fht.Recover();
    IssuePeriodicCheckpoints();
    ContinueSession();
  }
  
  /* Helper Functions */
  private void RunSession() 
  {
    using var session = fht.NewSession("s1");
    long seq = 0; // sequence identifier
    
    long key = 1, input = 10;
    while(true) 
    {
      key = (seq % 1L << 20);
      session.RMW(ref key, ref input, Empty.Default, seq++);
    }
  }
  
  private void ContinueSession() 
  {
    using var session = fht.ResumeSession("s1", out CommitPoint cp); // recovered session
    var seq = cp.UntilSerialNo + 1;
    
    long key = 1, input = 10;
    while(true) 
    {
      key = (seq % 1L << 20);
      session.RMW(ref key, ref input, Empty.Default, seq++);
    }
  }
  
  private void IssuePeriodicCheckpoints()
  {
    var t = new Thread(() => 
    {
      while(true) 
      {
        Thread.Sleep(10000);
        fht.TakeFullCheckpoint(out Guid token);
        fht.CompleteCheckpointAsync().GetAwaiter().GetResult();
      }
    });
    t.Start();
  }
}
```

FASTER supports two notions of checkpointing: Snapshot and Fold-Over. The former is a full snapshot of in-memory into a separate
snapshot file, whereas the latter is an _incremental_ checkpoint of the changes since the last checkpoint. Fold-Over effectively 
moves the read-only marker of the hybrid log to the tail, and thus all the data is persisted as part of the same hybrid log (there
is no separate snapshot file). All subsequent updates are written to new hybrid log tail locations, which gives Fold-Over its 
incremental nature. You can find a few basic checkpointing examples 
[here](https://github.com/Microsoft/FASTER/blob/master/cs/test/SimpleRecoveryTest.cs) and 
[here](https://github.com/Microsoft/FASTER/tree/master/cs/playground/SumStore). We plan to add more examples and details going
forward.
