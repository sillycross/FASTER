Introduction to FASTER C#
=========================

FASTER C# works in .NET Framework and .NET core, and offers two components. You can access their docs at the links below.

1. [FasterLog](FasterLog.md): A fast concurrent persistent log over memory and tiered storage, with lazy commits and tailing persistent iterators.
2. [FasterKV](FasterKV.md): A fast concurrent key-value store and cache over memory and tiered storage, with checkpointing and atomic 
update capabilities.
